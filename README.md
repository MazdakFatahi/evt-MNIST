# evt-MNIST
This is an event-driven version of MNIST dataset which can be used to evaluating spiking neural network's accuracy.
I used Poisson distribution to generating spike trains of images of MNIST dataset to extracting a spike-based dataset from a frame-based dataset respecting to intensity of each pixel of images. Using this method, I generate an event-driven dataset of MNIST called evt-MNIST which is contained  all the test and train images of  MNIST dataset.
Please be free to ask me any question about this dataset
